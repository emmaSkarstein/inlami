\title{Extract and group variables from formulas}
\usage{
extract_variables_from_formula(formula_moi, formula_imp)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula_moi}{an object of class "formula", describing the main model to be fitted.}

\item{formula_imp}{an object of class "formula", describing the imputation model for the mismeasured and/or missing observations.}
}
\value{
A list containing the names of the different variables of the model. The names of the elements in the list are "response_moi" (the response for the moi), "covariates_moi" (all covariates in the moi), "error_variable" (the name of the variable with error or missing data), "covariates_error_free" (the moi covariates without error), "response_imp" (imputation model response), "covariates_imp" (imputation model covariates).
}
\description{
Helper function that takes in the formulas for the model of interest and the
imputation model, and groups them into responses, covariates, covariate with
error and covariate(s) without error, for both sub-models.
}
\examples{
extract_variables_from_formula(formula_moi = y ~ x + z, formula_imp = x ~ z)
