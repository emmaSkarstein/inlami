Fitting measurement error models and missing data imputation models in
INLA is not trivial, and requires several workarounds in order to fit
the model. At the same time, a Bayesian hierarchical framework is very
attractive for modeling these types of data, since the hierarchical
model structure alllows us to describe how the data were collected, and
any errors they may have, through the model specification. By supplying
informative priors, we may be able to adjust for biases due to these
errors, and propagate any uncertainty they cause. Until recently, it has
been complicated to implement these kinds of models in INLA. This
package provides a helpful interface that makes measurement error and
missing data modelling in INLA much more feasible.
